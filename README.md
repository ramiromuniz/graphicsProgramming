# Interactive Image Processing and Emotion Detection Project üñºÔ∏èü§ñ

## Project Overview
This project that explores the world of **image processing**, **computer vision**, and **emotion detection** using the power of **p5.js** and **ml5.js**. It demonstrates how we can manipulate pixels to apply various filters, perform face detection, and even recognize emotions in real-time!

### What's Inside?
- **Pixel Manipulation**: Transform images by adjusting pixels to create effects like greyscale, blur, and even pixelation.
- **Color Space Conversion**: Converting images from one color space to another, revealing different aspects of images that aren't visible in the original color space.
- **Thresholding Techniques**: Explore how thresholding can highlight or hide certain features of an image based on color channels and intensity.
- **Face Detection**: Using the ml5.js face-api, we delve into computer vision to detect faces within images.
- **Emotion Detection**: Application of detecting emotions from faces, showcasing how technology can "read" our expressions.

### How It Works üõ†Ô∏è
- **Taking Snapshots**: With just a press of a button, capture live images from your webcam.
- **Applying Filters**: Switch between different filters to see the image transform in front of your eyes.
- **Detecting Faces and Emotions**: Watch in real-time as the software finds faces in the images and guesses emotions based on expressions.
